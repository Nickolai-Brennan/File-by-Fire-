### Setting Up Your Workflow

1. **Creating the Main Folder in Google Drive**
   - Go to Google Drive and create a new folder named `byGRIMM_Solutions`.
   - Inside this folder, create subfolders for each project, e.g., `Project_1`, `Project_2`, etc.

2. **Setting Up Your GitHub Repository**
   - Go to GitHub and create a new repository named `byGRIMM_Solutions_Repo`.
   - Clone this repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/byGRIMM_Solutions_Repo.git
     ```
   - Inside the cloned repository, create folders for each project similar to your Google Drive setup.

3. **Organizing Files and Folders**
   - Move all identified files into the appropriate project folders in both Google Drive and your GitHub repository.
   - Ensure consistency between the two locations to avoid confusion.

4. **Using GPT for Summarization**
   - For each file, use OpenAI ChatGPT-4 to generate a summary.
   - Save the summary in the `Summaries` folder in Google Drive.
   - Convert the original files to markdown and save them in the corresponding project folder in both Google Drive and GitHub.

### Example Workflow

1. **File Identification and Collection**
   - Gather files related to your writing projects.
   - Organize them into the appropriate folders in Google Drive and GitHub.

2. **Summarization and Conversion**
   - Use GPT-4 to summarize each file.
   - Save the summary in the `Summaries` folder.
